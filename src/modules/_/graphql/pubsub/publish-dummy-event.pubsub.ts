// Cases where you won't probably want it to be the same as the return type
// defined in the schema would be if you need data transformations which can
// be handled here as well or on the "resolve" field of the
// subscription resolver. The latter is recommended for visibility and to
// leave this function as a pure action creator (single responsibility).
